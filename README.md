# 📊 Power BI Fundamentals — From Data to Decisions

An interactive learning project that documents my journey through **Power BI fundamentals**, covering data import, transformation, modeling, and visualization, while presenting structured notes through a live web interface.

This project bridges **business intelligence concepts** with **modern frontend deployment**, turning learning notes into a shareable knowledge resource.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Raw business data rarely comes in a clean, analysis-ready format.  
Many beginners struggle not with visualization, but with:

- Cleaning inconsistent datasets  
- Understanding data models  
- Choosing the right visual for the right question  

This project focuses on **solving that gap** by clearly documenting the **end-to-end Power BI workflow**, from raw data to interactive insights.
